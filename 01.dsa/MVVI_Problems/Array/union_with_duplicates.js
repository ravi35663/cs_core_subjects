    Union of Arrays with Duplicates:

    Given two arrays a[] and b[], the task is to find the number of elements in the union between these two 
    arrays. The Union of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct elements from both 
    arrays. If there are repetitions, then only one element occurrence should be there in the union.

    Note: Elements of a[] and b[] are not necessarily distinct.

    Examples
        Input: a[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], b[] = [1, 2, 3]
        Output: 5
        Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are the elements which comes in the union setof both arrays. So count is 5.
        Input: a[] = [85, 25, 1, 32, 54, 6], b[] = [85, 2] 
        Output: 7
        Explanation: 85, 25, 1, 32, 54, 6, and 2 are the elements which comes in the union set of both arrays. So count is 7.
        Input: a[] = [1, 2, 1, 1, 2], b[] = [2, 2, 1, 2, 1] 
        Output: 2
        Explanation: We need to consider only distinct. So count is 2.
        Constraints:
        1 ≤ a.size(), b.size() ≤ 106
        0 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ 105

        if(!obj[item]){
            obj[item] = true;
            count++;
        }
    })
    b.forEach(item=>{
        if(!obj[item]){
            obj[item] = true;
            count++;
        }
    });
    return count;
}

const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const b = [1, 2, 3];
const result = unionOfTwoArr(a,b);
console.log("Unique number are: ",result);
